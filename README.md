# treeGame
Simulation game of chopping trees. The user can click and spawn in new things.
SDK: Oracle OpenJDK Version 20
How to run: Open the virtual world file in src and run. A screen should pop up for the simulation.
Summary: Use arrow keys to move the view of the map. Dudes cut down trees, and fairies replenish them if they aren't squashed. Clicking near a character
will turn them gold and make them faster and more powerful while spawning a leprechaun. Leprechauns also chop down trees and leave behind pots of gold.
Any characters within the vicinity of a pot of gold explosion will also turn golden.
